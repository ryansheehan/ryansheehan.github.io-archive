## Motivation

Starting my own personal site has been on my todo list for quite some time. Not
only have I been a professional software engineer for over 10 years, but I have
spent some time as a professional scrum master.  Over the years I have
accumulated many hard earned lessons that I think are worth sharing.

Not only do I wish to share my thoughts, but I believe writing is the next
appropriate step in my career.  Leadership is something I have always been
interested, and for a while now, my career has straddled this line between
software engineering and software development leadership.  To keep pushing my
career forward, I need present my thoughts and ideas to larger audiences.

Finally, I like to tinker with code!  A personal site would serve as an
excellent portfolio to any little side projects I put together; including this
site!

## Fears

It's always a little scary to put your ideas out to the world for criticism, but
I believe it is in discourse that great ideas rise to the top.  Arguably, one of
my best qualities is being forthcoming with opinions.  I believe that having to
justify your ideas to those both smarter than yourself, and to those that are
inexperienced and naive, is a great way to solidify and revalidate your
opinions.

Another fear is not being able to keep up with writing.  Time is a commodity
that is not bountiful for me.  I expect to fall off the wagon with regular
writing, but it's important to keep returning to writing.

My last fear is about maintenance.  Should I be able to write regularly there is
the potential the old ideas will not get updated.  My thoughts and ideas evolve,
and I wouldn't want outdated thoughts to define this site.

## Plans

In order to keep the motivation for writing, I believe I'll need to maintain a
topic list.  That way when it comes time to write, I don't have to first think
about a topic.  If I am not writing about a topic, I plan to journal progress on
any ongoing side projects.  My initial goal is to write one post per month.
Being regular will be critical to forming my writing habit.

Initially, I expect, my posts will be about getting this site up and running.
Documenting my thoughts about managing development projects, on a professional
level, will quickly follow.  I expect a bumpy ride to start, but I'm looking
forward to building up this site!
